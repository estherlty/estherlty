## Hi, I'm Esther :)

I'm a postdoctoral researcher with [@SURGroup](https://github.com/SURGroup) at the Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute of Johns Hopkins University.  
I work on **machine learning, molecular dynamics, and equation-of-state models** for materials under extreme conditions.

---
🔭 My work and expertise
- Developing **physics-constrained Gaussian Process Equation-of-State (GP-EOS) models**
- Integrating GP-EOS with hydrocodes for high-energy lasers/ high-compression experimental designs
- Running million-atom **molecular dynamics simulations** on high performance computing platforms

🚀 Interests
- Materials science under extreme conditions  
- Atomistic simulations for materials discovery
  
🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Density Functional Theory (DFT) and machaine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIP)
- Open-source scientific software development
